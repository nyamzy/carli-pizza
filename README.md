# Project Name

# Author(s) Information
  - John Nyamweya

# Setup Instructions
  - To access the github repository for this project, please use the following link (https://github.com/nyamzy/carli-pizza.git). You will be able to access the different files that I have used to make the website and also do any additional work on them.

# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
  This is how the website is supposed to work/behave:
  - You're supposed to be able to choose the size of pizza you want.
  - You're supposed to choose the kind of crust you want.
  - You're supposed to choose the kind of toppings you want on the pizza.
  - You're supposed to place an order of the pizza and see the total charge for it.
  - You're supposed to have an option to choose the number of pizzas you want.
  - You're supposed to have an option of delivery of pizza. If yes, it should show you how much it would cost.
  - You're supposed to have a prompt to give the location of the delivery.
  - You're supposed to see a checkout button which when clicked should show the total amount charged for the orders.
